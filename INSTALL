To build the interpreter:

	$ cd src
	$ make

This builds a binary called "lisp". Executing this binary puts you
in the lisp read-eval-print loop. To exit, type "quit".


To run the tests:

	$ cd test
	$ make

This builds three test programs. As each program is built, it is
executed. Each "." in the output is a passed test. Failed tests cause
the program to exit with an assert.
