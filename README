This lisp interpreter is based on Paul Graham's paper, "The Roots of
Lisp." (1)

It is made available under the terms of the GNU Lesser GPL 3.0. (2)

It is written in C and compiles with GCC 4.3.1. It should compile
with any C99 compliant compiler.

The interpreter supports the following lisp functions: cons, car,
cdr, atom, eq, quote, cond, lambda, and label.

Type "quit" to exit the interpreter.

The code is organised as follows:
+-----------------------+
|         main          |
+-----------------------+
| eval  |    parser     |
+-------+               |
| utils |               |
+-----------------------+
| cons_impl & constants |
+-----------------------+

The layering is not strict in the sense that higher layers may
interact with any lower layer, not just the layer immediately below.
For example, eval calls the cons_impl layer in addition to the utils
layer.

I wrote this program as a learning exercise for both C and lisp (my
background is C++).
